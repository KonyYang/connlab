# ConnLab Task Board

> Status: active
> Last Updated: 2026-04-26

> Current Active Task: `TASK_015_PACKAGING_NOTES`
> Current Phase: `Phase 4 - Shell Integration And Packaging`

## 1. Purpose

This board is stricter than a normal TODO list.

It is the shared execution control document for both humans and AI tools. It defines:

- required read order
- current mainline
- allowed active task
- phase status
- acceptance gates
- what must be updated after each completed task

If conversational memory conflicts with this board, this board wins.

---

## 2. Required Read Order For AI

Every new execution turn must read and obey documents in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `docs/task_board.md`
3. current active task file in `tasks/`
4. only then expand any additional referenced docs if the task requires them

Control meaning:

- `AGENTS.md` defines stable rules, MVP boundaries, forbidden scope, and architecture constraints.
- `docs/task_board.md` defines what task is allowed right now.
- `tasks/TASK_XXX_*.md` defines the implementation target and acceptance criteria for that task.

Minimum operator prompt:

```text
Read AGENTS.md first, then docs/task_board.md, then only the current active task file.
Implement only the active task allowed by docs/task_board.md.
Do not skip ahead.
Before coding, state the current phase and active task ID.
After finishing, update docs/task_board.md with status, validation, and next step.
```

---

## 3. Execution Rules

1. Only one active implementation task is allowed at a time unless the board explicitly opens parallel work.
2. A task may move to `done` only after code, tests, and board update are all completed.
3. If a requested task is ahead of the current active task, AI must stop and report the mismatch.
4. If a task uncovers missing prerequisite work, the board must be updated before moving on.
5. Future-scope work is forbidden even if related files already exist in the repository.

## 5. Phase Status

### Phase 0 - Repository Initialization

Goal:

- establish repository structure
- make FastAPI app importable
- add a passing smoke test

Status table:

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| T0-1 | `TASK_001_REPOSITORY_SCAFFOLD` | done | Scaffold, package init files, `/health`, smoke test completed on 2026-04-25 |

Acceptance gate:

- backend package exists
- minimal FastAPI app imports
- `/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`
- smoke test passes

### Phase 1 - Backend MVP Foundation

Goal:

- establish configuration, logging, storage foundation, domain skeleton, and application-facing API flow for MVP

Status table:

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| T1-1 | `TASK_002_CONFIG_LOGGING` | done | `Settings.load()` and `configure_logging()` landed with tests on 2026-04-25 |
| T1-2 | `TASK_003_SQLITE_DATABASE` | done | SQLite engine, session factory, Base, `init_db()`, and tests completed on 2026-04-26 |
| T1-3 | `TASK_004_DOMAIN_MODELS_MVP` | done | Pure dataclass domain models and enums completed on 2026-04-26 |
| T1-4 | `TASK_005_DATABASE_MODELS_AND_REPOSITORIES` | done | SQLAlchemy models and repositories completed with temp SQLite tests on 2026-04-26 |
| T1-5 | `TASK_006_PROJECT_SERVICE_AND_API` | done | Project service and `/api/projects` create/list/detail routes completed on 2026-04-26 |

Acceptance gate:

- settings and logger are explicit
- database location comes from settings
- MVP domain objects exist as structured records
- project service and thin API route layer are established

### Phase 2 - Intake And Precheck Flow

Goal:

- parse application form
- run deterministic precheck
- expose intake/precheck API path

Status table:

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| T2-1 | `TASK_007_APPLICATION_FORM_PARSER` | done | DOCX parser with synthetic fixture tests completed on 2026-04-26 |
| T2-2 | `TASK_008_PRECHECK_ENGINE` | done | Deterministic precheck rules completed with rule tests on 2026-04-26 |
| T2-3 | `TASK_009_INTAKE_PRECHECK_API` | done | Upload, parse, precheck, latest, and issue resolve API completed on 2026-04-26 |

Acceptance gate:

- application form fields are parsed into structured records
- precheck is deterministic
- route layer stays thin

### Phase 3 - LTR And Folder Flow

Goal:

- support LTR registration/tracking
- support folder preview and safe generation

Status table:

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| T3-1 | `TASK_010_LTR_MODULE` | done | LTR registration, project lookup, search, and duplicate protection completed on 2026-04-26 |
| T3-2 | `TASK_011_FOLDER_PREVIEW` | done | Template scan, placeholder replacement, and conflict preview completed on 2026-04-26 |
| T3-3 | `TASK_012_FOLDER_GENERATION` | done | Safe folder generation, original application form copy, persistence, and overwrite protection completed on 2026-04-26 |

Acceptance gate:

- LTR is structured and persisted
- folder generation is previewable
- no unsafe overwrite behavior

### Phase 4 - Shell Integration And Packaging

Goal:

- add minimal frontend shell
- connect MVP workflow
- document packaging notes

Status table:

| ID | Task | Status | Notes |
|----|------|--------|-------|
| T4-1 | `TASK_013_MINIMAL_FRONTEND_SHELL` | done | Minimal React + TypeScript shell with project list/detail and MVP task cards completed on 2026-04-26 |
| T4-2 | `TASK_014_MVP_WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION` | done | Frontend workflow actions, backend full-flow test, and manual smoke checklist completed on 2026-04-26 |
| T4-3 | `TASK_015_PACKAGING_NOTES` | active | Finalization task after MVP workflow integration |

Acceptance gate:

- frontend remains minimal
- integration only covers MVP flow
- packaging notes reflect real repository state

## 6. Completion Update Protocol

After finishing any task, AI must update this board in the same turn.

Minimum required updates:

1. change task status
2. update `Last Updated`
3. record validation result
4. record current stop point
5. activate the next allowed task or explain why the next task is blocked

Recommended completion note format:

```text
Completed:
- TASK_XXX_NAME

Validation:
- tests run
- key result

Next:
- next active task
- prerequisites or known limits
```

---

## 7. Current Validation Snapshot

Latest completed task:

- `TASK_014_MVP_WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION`

Validation result:

- `py -m pytest tests\integration\test_mvp_workflow_api.py tests\unit\test_frontend_shell_files.py -p no:cacheprovider`
- result: `5 passed`
- `npm run build` from `frontend/`
- result: build passed
- `py -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider`
- result: `37 passed`

Known limits:

- packaging notes are not written yet
- no report generation, AI review, Matrix, or future-scope features

---

## 8. Next Recommended Action

Current recommendation:

- execute `TASK_015_PACKAGING_NOTES`

Why this is next:

- `TASK_003` established the SQLite engine, session factory, Base, and `init_db()`
- `TASK_004` established pure MVP domain models and enums
- `TASK_005` established SQLAlchemy models and repositories
- `TASK_006` established project service and thin project API
- `TASK_007` established structured DOCX parser output
- `TASK_008` established deterministic precheck rules
- `TASK_009` exposed parser + precheck flow through API
- `TASK_010` established LTR registration/tracking
- `TASK_011` established safe folder preview
- `TASK_012` established safe folder generation with persistence and overwrite protection
- `TASK_013` established the minimal React + TypeScript shell
- `TASK_014` connected the MVP workflow through backend and frontend
- packaging notes are the finalization step after the MVP workflow is usable

Do not start yet:

- post-MVP tasks before `TASK_015` is done
- any Matrix, Report, AI, or future-scope feature
